<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue" />

<p>I am someone who has an unwavering resolve. Every day I work to improve myself and my skills, which is part of maturing and becoming better at what I do. My parents think of me, the opposite. Scientists call it strategic self-anticonformity (a.k.a <em>Reverse Psychology</em>). Well, worked out for me.</p>

<p>I did a Bachelor of Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering from <a href="https://ku.edu.np/program/ung-in-electrical-and-electronics-engineering">Kathmandu University</a>. After graduation, I worked as a Technical Supervisor at <a href="https://www.garudsecurities.com.np/">Garud Securities</a>. Then I moved to Canada. I did my Postgraduate Degree in Big Data Analytics followed by Postgraduate Degree in Information System Security from <a href="https://www.georgiancollege.ca/">Georgian College</a>.</p>

<p>During my time in Georgian College, I used to work part-time in Firehouse Subs. If you ever go to the Firehouse Subs, try ordering “Italian”. It is the best sub, you will devour it in one bite.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about hobbies. I love football. By football, I mean “Soccer”. I am a huge admirer of <a href="https://www.manutd.com/">Manchester United</a> (<em>Although, the hyperlink is blue, remember Manchester is always Red !!!</em> ). Recently, I started supporting Toronto Raptors. We the North.</p>

<p>I don’t want to make it more boring and above all myself vulnerable by telling you more about my life. After all, Human emotion and interaction are reduced to nothing more than data. Peace !!!</p>
