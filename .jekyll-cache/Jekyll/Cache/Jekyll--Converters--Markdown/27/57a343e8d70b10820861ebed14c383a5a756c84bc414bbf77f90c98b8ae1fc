<p>So, I thought to my self, why not start a blog. A blog about the things, I love doing. The first thing I needed was a good text editor. Dennis Simpson and his <a href="https://zonzorp.github.io/">courses</a> about Information System Security introduced me to the Linux world. The guy was a wizard with Vim. I wished to be like him. Here I am now, with <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-markdown-cheat-sheet-3d3976b31a0">The Ultimate Markdown Cheat Sheet</a> and the book <strong>Mastering Vim</strong> by Ruslan Osipov hoping one day I will be like Dennis.</p>

<h2 id="vim">Vim</h2>
<p>A modal interface, where each trigger performs a different action based upon context.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-on-linux">Setting up on Linux</h2>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
cd vim/src
make
sudo make install
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We can update Vim using a package manger as well.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install vim-gtk
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We can start the editor by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vi</code>. On older systems the two are different binaries. There are graphical version of Vim like Vanilla Vim and GVim.</p>
<h2 id="verifying-installation-and-trouble-shooting">Verifying installation and trouble shooting</h2>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>vim --version
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In output, a set of features having a + and a - infront of them will be shown. For example, Vim if complied with Python 2 support will dispaly (+python) instead of Python3 support (-python3)</p>

<p>I am not gonna talk about the .vimrc files. It is a different world. It is the configuration file for Vim where we can configure things like syntax highlighting, consistent indentation etc.</p>
