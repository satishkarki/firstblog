<p>I am someone who has an unwavering resolve. Every day I work to improve myself and my skills, which is part of maturing and becoming better at what I do. My parents think of me, the opposite. Scientists call it strategic self-anticonformity (a.k.a <em>Reverse Psychology</em>). Well, worked out to me.</p>

<p>When the map of <a href="/assets/portugal.jpg">Portugal</a> is turned ninety degrees, it resembles <a href="/assets/nepal.png">Nepal</a>, the country where I was born. Would you believe me if I said, I was born in 2051 ? (When in Nepal, You live in the Future). Nepal follows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikram_Samvat">Vikarami Calender</a>, which is 57 years ahead of Gregorian Calender. Do the math. I was born in 1994 AD.</p>

<p>I did Bachelor of Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering from <a href="https://ku.edu.np/program/ung-in-electrical-and-electronics-engineering">Kathmandu University</a>. After graduating I worked as a Technical Supervisor at <a href="https://www.garudsecurities.com.np/">Garud Securities</a>. Then I moved to Canada. I did my Postgraduate Degree in Big Data Analytics followed by Postgraduate Degree in Information System Security from <a href="https://www.georgiancollege.ca/">Georgian College</a>.</p>

<p>During my time in Georgian College, I used to work part-time in Firehouse Subs. If you ever go to the Firehouse Subs, try ordering “Italian”. A fully involved Italian, with Honey Mustard and Peppercorn Ranch dressing is delectable. You will devour your sandwich in one bite. Alright,enough about food.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about hobbies. I love football. By football I mean “Soccer”. I am a huge admirer of <a href="https://www.manutd.com/">Manchester United</a> (<em>Although, hyperlink is blue, remember Manchester is always Red !!!</em> ). Recently, I started supporting Toronto Raptors. We the North.</p>

<p>I guess this is the end. If you are still here then I believe my persuasion technique worked. After all, persuasion is the centerpiece of business activity. Company sells themselves to the customers,</p>
