<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Google receives over 63,000 searches per second on any given day. Thatâ€™s the average figure of how many people use Google a day, which translates into at least 5.6 billion searches per day. Pretty impressive, right? <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/">Check it out.</a></p>

<p>It takes about 50 milliseconds (thatâ€™s 0.05 seconds) for anyone to form an opinion about a website. If you are still reading this, Hurray!!! I choose to believe, you havenâ€™t made an extreme level of snap judgment about my homepage.</p>

<p>However, if I were you, I would have swiftly closed this tab (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CTRL+W</code> is the keyboard shortcut, donâ€™t do it, Plz!). I know my Github page sucks. I am still learning how <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> works, and with the mystical power of HTML and CSS, I will embellish this page (<em>fingers crossed</em>). Appearance matters, a front-end girl would certainly say, but I am more of a terminal guy. Teehee.</p>
