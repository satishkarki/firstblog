This program prepares me for the [CompTIA A+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a) exams. This blog is about the first course [Technical Support Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/technical-support-fundamentals?specialization=google-it-support) and summarizes the things I found useful.

# Week 3: Operating System

## Remote Connection and SSH
* Comparison of [SSH Clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_clients)
* Comparison of [SSH Servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_servers)
* Linux: [OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/index.html)
* Windows: PuTTY, [download link for PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
    * ```
  ssh username@ipaddress
  ```
* SSH uses port 22
* In PowerShell
    * ```
  putty.exe -ssh username@ipaddress port
  ```
* RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol
  * Microsoft Terminal Services Client **mstc.exe**

## Operating System

* **User Space**
  * Applications
  * CLI and GUI
* **Kernel Space** 
  * Process Manager
  * Memory Manager
  * File Manager
  * I/O Manager

## Files and File Systems

* File Handling:
  * Data, Metadata, File System
* File System
  * Windows: [NTFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS) [FAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table)
  * Windows is developing another file system [ReFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReFS)
  * As of March 2017 the default file system in Apple devices is [APFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System)
  * Apple used [HFS+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus) before APFS
  * Linux : the most common one is [ext4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4)
* Block Storage
  * data not stored in one long piece, improves file handling

## Process Management

* Kernel creates processes, efficiently schedules them,and manages how processes are terminated
* kernel creates time slice for each process

## Memory Management

* [Virtual Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory): Combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use
* **Pages**: When we execute a process, we take the data of the program in chunks knowns as pages and load these pages to Virtual Memory
* [Swap Space](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-space-in-operating-system/):  When we store our virtual memory on our hard drive, we call the allocated space, swap space

## I/O Management

* These I/O devices are all managed by our kernel, the kernel needs to be able to load up drivers that are used, so that we can recognize and speak to these different types of hardware

## Log

* files that record system events on our computer just like a system's diary

## Boot Process
* pull oneself up by one's bootstraps
* *To help you load your installation image onto a USB drive, you may want to look at the tool, [etcher.io](https://etcher.io/)*
