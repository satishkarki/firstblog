# Week 5 Software

* Coding is translating one language to another
* When writing code, a script is usually used to perform a single or limited-range task
* **Types of software**
  * Application Software: MS Word
  * System Software: Windows, MacOS
  * Firmware: Example BIOS
* Supplemental Reading on [Software Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning)
* Complier: It compiles human readable code into machine level code
* Interpreter: The script is run by an interpreter , which interprets the code into CPU instructions just in time to run them
* Automation makes processes works automatically
* Verifying Software Installed in Linux:
  * To quickly check if a program is installed on Linux, you can use the command "dpkg -s" followed by the unique package name for that program. The "-s" flag in dpkg stands for "search," which allows you to search for a program on your machine and check if it's installed
  * Example: ***dpkg -s firefox-esr***
  * ***sudo apt-get install -f***  This command forces an update of the package manager
  * ***dpkg -s vlc*** This command shows the status of the installed package
  * ***sudo apt-get update*** Many programs are in repositories that the most Linux distributions are aware of, by default. This command makes sure these repositories are up-to-date and all dependencies are fixed
  * ***sudo apt-get install firefox-esr*** Installs the firefox
  * ***sudo apt-get remove gimp*** command to uninstall
