Isn't it fascinating when a stupid machine that still thinks 1+1 equals 10 can do so many dazzling things from basic arithmetic to guiding us home safely, telling us which lane to take? Do you ever wonder, when an online store suggests us the T-shirt's size by just letting it know our height and weight, a company hiring us because its recruiting app matches the keywords in our resume? Our future is indulged in AI. Look at this progression, from mechanical inventions and mathematical theories towards modern computer concepts. The progress from the first photo uploaded on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, to 50 billion photos uploaded to Instagram so far. The same machine I said stupid now controlling my dopamine level when I spend so many hours scrolling through all these photos on Instagram. Who is stupid now? Humans? No. 

We are smart. Our parents always tell us to do the right thing but have you ever questioned how they know the right thing is. It is because they have also made mistakes and do not want you to fail. We, humans, are flawed. We keep making mistakes because our imagination has no boundaries. Yes or no aren't the only options for humans. Everything cannot be logical when we don't know all the outcomes. But we removed this flaw in the machine and gave them this logical boundary of 1 and 0. It should be either true or false. These are the only possible outcome, and there is no middle ground. That's how we validate the results produced by it.

Based on this elementary concept of the computing system, we have advanced so far, yet the only constant thing is the change. And it enthralls me that we are dancing with all these bits and bytes bending it according to our needs. I always wanted to know it. That's why I plunged into this ocean of IT. I am exploring this vast ocean with no seabed. I want to dive deeper because it is a profound feeling.
