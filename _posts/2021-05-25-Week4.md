This program prepares me for the [CompTIA A+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a) exams. This blog is about the first course [Technical Support Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/technical-support-fundamentals?specialization=google-it-support) and summarizes the things I found useful.

# Week 4: Networking

## Basics of Networking

* The Internet is the physical connection of computers and wires around the world
* The web is the information on the Internet
* When we send or receive data through a network, we need to have both an IP and a MAC address
* MAC addresses are generally permanent and hard coded onto the devices
* Data is sent through a network as a packet

## Network Hardware

* Ethernet cable
* Wi-fi
* Optical Fiber
* Router
* Switches and Hub

## Language of the Internet

* IP:  It is responsible for delivering our packets to the right computers
* TCP: It handles reliable delivery of information from one network to another

## The Web

* ```
  www.reddit.com
  ```
* URL: Uniform Resource Locator, is just a web address similar to a home address
* Domain Name: reddit is a domain name, Once a name is taken, it'll be registered to ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers

## Limitations of the Internet

* History of the Internet
  * 1960s. the US government spun up a project called DARPA
  * DARPA: Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
  * [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET): Advanced Research Projects Agency Network 
  * 1970s: computer scientists Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn, who created the method we call the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP
  * 1990s: a computer scientist by the name of Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web
* Even though it might seem like a lot of possible IPv4 addresses, there are less than 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses
* Solution: With IPv6 there are 2 to the 128 power possible IP addresses, 2 to the 128 power is an insanely huge number
* Solution: Network Address Translation
